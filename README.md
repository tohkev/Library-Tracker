# Library Tracker

## Description

This is a layout used to track the books you are currently reading. In this project I explored the use of objects and object prototypes. Some features of this site includes: Read/unread status toggling, responsive web design, adding new entries based on title, author, and genre, deleting entries you no longer need, and tracking the total number of books read/unread

## Technology Used:

- HTML
- CSS (+Bootstrap)
- JavaScript
